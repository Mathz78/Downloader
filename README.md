# Downloader

I did this project because I need to automate my tasks, I download some sentences in mp3 audio format to put in Anki, because I use Anki to learn new languages. So basically this script downloads the file and renames it to the phrase contained in the file.


I usually use this website to download the audios that i need: https://www.manythings.org/audio/sentences/
